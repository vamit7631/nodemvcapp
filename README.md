A callback is a function that is to be executed after another function has finished executing — hence the name ‘call back’.

A Promise is a value returned by an asynchronous function to indicate the completion of the processing carried out by the asynchronous function. Promises can be nested within each other to make code look better and easier to maintain when many asynchronous function need to be called at the same time.
